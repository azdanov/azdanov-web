After ~3 years of studying, building, learning and pushing forward every day, I've decided that my knowledge has reached the level adequate for working in professional development.

I've started sending out my résumé to local companies, and to my delight, I didn't have to wait long. Several offered a chance for an interview by building a small test project. The interviews went well, and I had to choose which role and technology stack to work with.

In the end, the company that I'm working for is using a Java and Vue.js stack for their projects. My role is as a Full Stack Developer.

## Encouragements

For those who are studying either in a university or on their own, the only advice I can give is not to give up. Sooner or later you will reach your set goals. And the only way there is one step at a time.
