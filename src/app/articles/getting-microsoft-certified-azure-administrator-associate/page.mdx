Next step accomplished, the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104) exam has been successfully passed.
The exam itself was a mixed experience, with some questions being very easy, and some being very tricky. I have spent around
40 days to prepare for it (almost full-time and no days off), and I got 860/1000 score.

There were a bunch of questions about older Azure services, which I have never used, so I had to guess the answers,
e.g., general-purpose v1 / blob storage (those will be deprecated soon). Or very specific questions which I couldn't find afterward
even though I tried to find an answer in the documentation (virtual machine scale sets update domain related). And some questions were very basic,
just selecting an appropriate service to use out of a list of options that should've been only in AZ-900.

I did enjoy the questions that required me to think more based on an example picture and figure out what's wrong with it, or to
choose an appropriate solution. Or reading an ARM template or a Policy definition. I liked questions that you can logically
think through and find the answer, instead of just memorizing some fact from documentation.

I would say that it was beneficial to pass AZ-900 first, to get a general understanding of Azure services, and to see
how the exam itself is done. But I don't see myself doing any other 900-level exams in the future, only if I have a free voucher.

## Preparation

I have used the following resources:

- [Cloudlee: AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.cloudlee.io/p/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator) - Course is 23 hours long, and it covers all the topics in the exam. I went through this course 2 times, so good it was. I highly recommend it.
- [Microsoft Learn: Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104/) - Official training material, with free a sandbox to practice hands-on.
- [YouTube: John Savill's AZ-104 Azure Administrator Study List](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs) - Another really amazing playlist on YouTube by John Savill.
- [Tutorials Dojo: AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Practice Exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-practice-exams/) - Very useful practice exams by Tutorials Dojo.
- [MeasureUp: Microsoft Practice Test AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft-practice-test-az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator.html/) - Some additional practice exams. I wouldn't recommend, too expensive and lots of irrelevant and difficult questions.

The next step for me is to get the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-developer/) certificate.

## Final thoughts

Why do I want to get certified? I don't think that it's a good way to prove your knowledge (it's too easy to find exam dumps
and memorize the answers without understanding why), but it's a good way to structure your learning process. It forces you to learn things that you
wouldn't learn otherwise (how would I find out that [MARS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-about-mars) exists on my own ðŸ˜„?),
and it gives you a deeper dive of the services that Azure provides.

I remember, when I was using AWS at my previous job, I was exposed and limited to only a few services, and I didn't know what else AWS
could offer and didn't have time to learn more about the services that were being used or if there was a better alternative or
some architectural pattern. Only recently I've learned about [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/),
and I see great value in learning how to use cloud services properly. Azure has a similar [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/)
and [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) which I would like to go over one day.

In the end, I'd like to find a job that uses cloud technologies extensively, and hopefully using Azure. I'm not sure how
valuable the certificate itself will be, but studying and following the exam structure is helping me to get the experience needed
for the job.
