What could be considered the most important skill nowadays? Of course, it depends on the line of work one does. Yet we hear a lot about the importance of so-called _soft_ skills. That _math_ or _algorithms_ or _logic_ is important. It's clear that there is no fixed standard concerning skills.

Let's get to the origin of this stuff. _Learning_. Without _learning_ would it be possible to acquire knowledge of _soft_ skills? Would it be possible to learn _math_ or _programming_? Probably impossible.

## Learning

We now can see that _learning_ is important. But how can _learning_ be learned? And what does it mean to _learn_ something?

The simple answer is _practice_ and _repetition_. Until familiarity sets in, thus something becomes a _skill_.

For example _juggling_, at first, it's hard, unrewarding, and doesn't resemble anything at all. But as it gets familiar, incredible feats can be accomplished. And something clumsy can become a valuable _skill_.

So _learning_ is the journey, the process of getting from an undesirable place to where one wants to be. And since it is also a skill, then repetition and practice also enhance _learning_.

## Resources

Of course, there are many tips, tricks, and shortcuts one can employ to make the journey comfortable and productive. There are experts in the field of learning, who write books, create videos and whole courses on the subject.

I will share some of them:

- [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) - A course which is taught by [Dr. Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) that dives deep into the process of learning, how our brains work, and what are the most efficient ways to learn. A bird's eye view of the learning landscape.
- [A Mind For Numbers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers) - A companion book to the previously mentioned course. Reading this book along while doing the course really helps to solidify the _learning_ skill. Remember _repetition_ and _practice_?
- [The Slight Edge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590652.The_Slight_Edge) - Teaches how small consistent chunks of any action, positive or negative, build up to an avalanche, in the end, that will either carry you where you want to get or to some undesirable place. Habits matter.
- [The Power of Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit) - Habits do govern our lives, whether we notice that or not. This book really helped me to see why I do certain things, and ignore others. Habit forming is detrimental to the _learning_ skill.
- [The Power of Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6708.The_Power_of_Now) - Mindfulness. Understanding how thoughts can affect us. How and why it is important to "control" the thinking process, is the main idea of this book. In short, _letting go_ is the answer.

And a reminder to myself: do reiterate the mentioned resources and continue _learning how to learn_ with other books and courses.
