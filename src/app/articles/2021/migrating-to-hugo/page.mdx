My last update to this website was a migration from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with a custom made theme to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with modified [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) theme. And while it was very educational and inspiring to see what kind of performance improvements were possible the theme itself became a bit difficult to manage, requiring a lot of maintenance.

After trying out Go for hobby projects I've been intrigued with a static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and decided to try it with a custom theme [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng).

The end result was very satisfying. It was easy to setup, build time is lightning fast and thus far, I assume, maintenance will be also minimal.

Let's see if I will focus more time on writing and less on resolving merge conflicts or npm updates for my website. ðŸ˜„
