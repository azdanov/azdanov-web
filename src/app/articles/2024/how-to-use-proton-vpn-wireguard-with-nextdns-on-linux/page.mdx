If you're using Linux and want to combine the security of Proton VPN with the advanced DNS features of NextDNS, here's a quick guide to set it up.

## Steps for updating the Proton VPN WireGuard configuration

1. Download your Proton VPN WireGuard config from the [Proton VPN WireGuard configuration](https://account.proton.me/u/0/vpn/WireGuard).
2. Get your NextDNS configuration ID and Endpoints from the [NextDNS dashboard](https://my.nextdns.io).
4. In the downloaded wireguard config remove the `DNS =` line from the `[Interface]` section.
5. Add a `PostUp` command to configure NextDNS using `resolvectl` and your NextDNS ID and Endpoints: `PostUp = resolvectl dns %i 172.16.80.142#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 172.16.83.142#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 2001:db8:a0b:12f1::1#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io; resolvectl dnsovertls %i yes; resolvectl domain %i ~.`
6. Save the modified config file.

Here's how it might look:
```text
[Interface]
# Key for GB#1
# Bouncing = 0
# NetShield = 0
# Moderate NAT = off
# NAT-PMP (Port Forwarding) = off
# VPN Accelerator = on
PrivateKey = <PrivateKey>
Address = <Address>
PostUp = resolvectl dns %i 172.16.80.142#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 172.16.83.142#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io 2001:db8:a0b:12f1::1#ubuntu-1234a5.dns.nextdns.io; resolvectl dnsovertls %i yes; resolvectl domain %i ~.

[Peer]
# GB#1
PublicKey = <PublicKey>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = <Address>
```

**NB: I removed personal values and used random ones for IPv4, IPv6 and NextDNS ID. Make sure to use your own.**

This setup leverages `systemd-resolved`, which some Linux distributions use by default. The `PostUp` command configures NextDNS when the WireGuard connection is established.

Now you can enjoy the combined benefits of Proton VPN's security and NextDNS's advanced filtering and analytics!

## Managing WireGuard Configuration and Connection

### Configuration File Location

After modifying your WireGuard configuration file, you should place it in the appropriate directory:

1. Save the configuration file with a .conf extension (e.g., `wg0.conf`).
2. Move the file to `/etc/wireguard/`. You may need root privileges for this:
    ```text
    sudo mv wg0.conf /etc/wireguard/
    ```

### WireGuard CLI Commands

Here are some useful WireGuard CLI commands to manage your VPN connection:

1. Start the WireGuard connection:
    ```text
    sudo wg-quick up wg0
    ```

2. Stop the WireGuard connection:
    ```text
    sudo wg-quick down wg0
    ```

3. Check the status of your WireGuard interfaces:
    ```text
    sudo wg show
    ```

### Enabling/Disabling Autostart on System Boot
To enable autostart of your WireGuard connection on system boot:

1. Enable the WireGuard service:
    ```text
    sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
    ```

2. Start the service immediately:
    ```text
    sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
    ```

To disable autostart:

1. Disable the WireGuard service:
    ```text
    sudo systemctl disable wg-quick@wg0.service
    ```

2. Stop the service if it's currently running:
    ```text
    sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
    ```

Remember to replace wg0 in these commands with the actual name of your configuration file (without the .conf extension) if it's different.

And that's about it. You're all set up to use Proton VPN WireGuard with NextDNS on Linux.

You can use [https://ip.me](https://ip.me) to verify that your IP address is now that of the Proton VPN server you're connected to.
And [https://test.nextdns.io](https://test.nextdns.io) or [https://ping.nextdns.io](https://ping.nextdns.io) to verify that your DNS queries are now going through NextDNS.
