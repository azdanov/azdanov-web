## What is CKAD?

The CKAD is a certificate from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It checks if you can design, build, and manage applications for Kubernetes, which is a tool for running apps in a cloud environment. What's cool about this exam is it's all about doing, not just answering questions. You have to show you can actually work with Kubernetes.

## The Exam

- Time: The exam lasts 2 hours.
- You'll work on tasks like:
  - Building container images
  - Deploying apps
  - Keeping an eye on apps and fixing them if needed
  - Setting up the environment
  - Managing services and networks

I really liked that the exam is practical. Instead of choosing from answers, you work on tasks like you would at work. It's challenging because you're under time pressure.

## How I Prepared

Here are some things that helped me get ready:

- GitHub: There are lots of free study materials and practice tasks from other developers on GitHub.
  - https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises
  - https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-crash-course
- Courses: I took some courses on Udemy that went through everything I needed to know. They had practice exercises too.
  - https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/
  - https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-microservices/
- Practice: I set up Kubernetes on my computer using minikube and practiced. You need to be comfortable with `kubectl` and learn tricks on how to speed up your workflow to be able to do the exam in 2 hours.
  - https://killer.sh is a good resource for a practice exam, but it is much more difficult than the real one. Good way to see how well you're doing under time pressure.

I might have prepared more than I needed to, but it was worth it. I learned a lot about Kubernetes, which will definitely help me in the future.

## What’s Next?

I'd like to get CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator and CKS: Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist next. We'll see how it goes.
