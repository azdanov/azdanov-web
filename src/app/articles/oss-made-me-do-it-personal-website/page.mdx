This website would not exist without open-source software. Many applications that are popular would not exist without open-source software. And even some jobs would be impossible without open-source software. So I guess OSS is quite important.

But back to my website. On the outside, it may look simple, but many complicated concepts were used during its creation. Different languages, tools that convert and optimize code, mechanisms for putting everything together. Of course, plain old `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS` can still be used, but nowadays it's just not enough.

Tech leaders are constantly raising the bar on expectations. Websites are getting faster, they have more features and can do a lot more than before. Sometimes the edge between a desktop application and a web-based one is so thin that it's hard to notice. Consider some of the popular ones like _Gmail_, _Dropbox_, _Google Docs_. Before a user needed an _email client_ installed and configured on a computer. And _ftp program_ with an external preconfigured host to upload and download files. And a locally installed, often heavyweight, _word processor_.

And by using community made open-source software it is possible to catch up to and even surpass your end-users expectations. And everyone can agree that a happy user is always good for business.

## Acknowledgements

Many different tools were used in the process of creating this website. If I missed some it's not because they are unimportant _(amnesia happens)_.

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Blazingly fast site generator for [React](https://reactjs.org/) that can be used for building blogs, e-commerce sites, and full-blown apps.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A library for building modern, fast and maintainable user interfaces and in my case websites.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - An open-source programming language which is a strict syntactical superset of _JavaScript_, and adds optional static typing to the language. In other words, building complex projects get a lot easier.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - As its name implies, _Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets_, it's an extension for [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) language, that adds numerous features, which have become an industry standard by this point.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - "[…] is an open-source, cross-platform _JavaScript_ run-time environment that executes _JavaScript_ code outside the browser". What was not hard or impossible before, is simple thanks to _Node.js_.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - A hosting provider that simplifies the building, deploying, and managing of modern web projects. And it's also free.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - "[…] brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software". As their description state, OSS is possible because of _GitHub_ and similar services that simplify cooperation.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for _Windows_, _macOS_, and _Linux_. It comes with built-in support for _JavaScript_, _TypeScript_ and _Node.js_ and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages.
