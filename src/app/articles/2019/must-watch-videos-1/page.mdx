import Image from "next/image";
import { ArticleLayout } from "../../../../components/ArticleLayout";
import video from "./video.png";

export const article = {
  author: "Anton Å½danov",
  date: "2019-04-05T21:31:48.547Z",
  title: "Must watch videos 1",
  description: "A series of videos that I found useful.",
};

export const metadata = {
  title: article.title,
  description: article.description,
}

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout article={article} {...props} />;

<Image src={video} alt="video" />

I would like to start a collection of useful videos that I've found online.

Although they are centered around Laravel, the ideas are easy to adopt in any other framework.

Here goes the first batch!
