While learning about SQL Server stored procedures, I came across two statements that I had never seen before: XACT_ABORT and NOCOUNT.
I was curious about what they do, so I decided to learn more and to share my findings.

Generally speaking, XACT_ABORT is a transaction option that determines whether the transaction is rolled back when certain additional errors occur which isn't turned on for backwards compatibility and
NOCOUNT is a session option that determines whether the number of rows affected by a statement is returned to the client.

- **XACT_ABORT** - Good for avoiding unexpected behavior connected to rolling back a transactions
- **NOCOUNT** - Good for performance if the procedure is used in a loop by eliminating a network call

Here's a small example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE insert
  @a int,
  @b int
AS
  SET XACT_ABORT, NOCOUNT ON;
  INSERT INTO table (a, b) VALUES (@a, @b);
```

Main resource that I used to learn more about these statements were from an article by [Erland Sommarskog - Error and Transaction Handling in SQL Server](https://www.sommarskog.se/error_handling/Part1.html).
