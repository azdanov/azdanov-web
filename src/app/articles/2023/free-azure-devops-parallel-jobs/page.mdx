As someone who started learning Azure DevOps, I encountered a problem with the free tier of Azure DevOps.

When logging in and creating a new organization, I navigated to `Organization Settings > Parallel Jobs` and saw that
for Microsoft-hosted agents I have zero parallel jobs and for self-hosted agents I have one parallel job.
Which meant that you can create your own VM and run your own agent on it, but for that you'll need to pay for the VM.

To get the free Microsoft-hosted agent, you'll need to fill out a form and wait for the approval: https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request

I had a billing setup for my Azure account, which I also used for Azure DevOps, but maybe it wasn't necessary.

And you can read more about the configuration of parallel jobs here, and current request process for free grant: https://aka.ms/microsofthosted
