For a long time, I've been curious about how to host a Spring Boot application in the cloud, such as AWS or Azure.
I've had some experience with AWS, but it was with the serverless approach, where you don't have to worry about the infrastructure.
Same with Azure, where App Service is a quick and easy way to host an app, but it abstracts away a lot of things.

## Stratospheric: From Zero to Production with Spring Boot and AWS

I've found a book called [Stratospheric](https://stratospheric.dev/) about learning [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for a Spring Boot app.
It was in my backlog, but I finally started going through it.

This book provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a Spring Boot app and deploy it to AWS. It explains
the concepts of CloudFormation, and then it shows how to use AWS CDK to create the infrastructure for the app.

I've yet to finish the book, but I've already learned more about using AWS CDK and AWS in general.
I had limited experience with CloudFormation, which I didn't know how to use correctly, and no experience with AWS CDK. Previously, I only used the
[Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy my apps to AWS.

## Next Steps

As I continue reading the book, I'll write more about my experience with AWS CDK, AWS, and Spring Boot.
