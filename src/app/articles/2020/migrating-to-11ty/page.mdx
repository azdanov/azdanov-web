After getting hired I have been busy at work. Learning all the new things to become productive and productive team member.

Sadly this led to neglecting my website for a while... Not any longer.

I have decided to freshen up my blog and moving away from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
The main reason is simplicity, because [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) offers simple solution for a simple blog without the complexity of GraphQL or React.

Special thanks to [cramforce](https://x.com/cramforce) for creating [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) starter kit.
