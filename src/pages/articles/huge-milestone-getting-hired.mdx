After ~3 years of studying, building, learning and pushing forward every day I've decided that my knowledge has reached the level adequate for working in a professional development.

I've started sending out my resume to local companies, and to my delight I didn't have to wait long. Several offered a chance for an interview by building a small test project. The interviews went well, and I had to choose which role and technology stack to work with.

In the end the company that I'm working for is using a Java and Vue.js stack for their projects. My role is as a Full Stack Developer.

## Encouragements

For those who are studying either in a university or on their own the only advice I can give is not to give up. Sooner or later you will reach your set goals. And the only way there is one step at a time.
