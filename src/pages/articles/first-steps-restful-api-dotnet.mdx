I started learning C# and .NET a few weeks ago and finished a course on building a modern RESTful API. I would like to share that I've finished a GitHub project and have a certificate from the website.

The course I took was from [Nick Chapsas - From Zero to Hero:
REST APIs in .NET](https://nickchapsas.com/p/from-zero-to-hero-rest-apis-in-asp-net-core), a well-known YouTube instructor with many years of experience building production APIs in .NET. It taught me how to create a REST API end-to-end from scratch using the latest .NET 7, Dapper and other libraries. The course uses the C# (obviously), which is one of my favorites and the reasons for switching from Java and Node.js.

The REST API I built is a simple movie app that allows users to create, read, update and delete movies and ratings associated with a movie. It uses ASP.NET, Dapper for data access, PostgreSQL
for database storage, and Swagger for documentation.

I've made a GitHub project that contains all the source code and instructions on how to run it locally. You can find it here: https://github.com/azdanov/MoviesApp

The course covered a bunch of topics, including:

- Basics of HTTP verbs and CRUD
- Building a RESTful API with data validation
- Authentication and authorization
- User-specific actions
- Filtering, sorting, pagination, versioning and swagger
- Building an SDK and consuming the API
- Minimal API

After completing the course, I got a certificate, nice surprise. Here it is:

I really enjoyed this course and can recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to create REST APIs with .NET 7 and C#. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me.
