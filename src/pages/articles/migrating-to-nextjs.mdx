After a long time of using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), I decided to migrate my blog to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). There was nothing particularly wrong with Hugo,
but I wanted to try something new, and I was curious about Next.js. I also wanted to try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), which I had heard a lot about.
I had a chance to use it at work, and I liked it a lot. And having a personal website is a perfect candidate for trying out new things.

For the theme, I decided to use [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) Spotlight, which is a paid theme offered as part
of Tailwind UI that is a component library made with Tailwind CSS. I modified it a bit to fit my needs. And will probably
continue to adjust it to my needs as I go.

Overall, I am very happy with the result. I like the way Next.js works and the theme looks fabulous. As a bonus, the
project uses the same language everywhere, which is a big plus. It was a bit difficult when there were some Go-specific
things while using Hugo.
