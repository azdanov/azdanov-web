The first major step on my way to learn and use Azure was to pass the Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) exam.
Exam itself is not hard, but it requires a lot of preparations and memorization and luck, since some questions I didn't
encounter while preparing. I have passed it on the first try, but I wouldn't say that it was a breeze.

I have spent around 10 days to prepare for it, with a final score of 925/1000. I have several years of experience with
software development, and I have used AWS in production, so I was familiar with the concepts of cloud computing and cloud services.

## Preparation

I have used the following resources:

- [Microsoft Learn: Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900/) - Official training material, with free a sandbox to practice hands-on.
- [YouTube: John Savill's AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals Certification Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nED0_vMEniWBQjSoxTsBYS3) - A really amazing course on YouTube by John Savill.
- [Tutorials Dojo: AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Practice Exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-practice-exams/) - Very useful practice exams by Tutorials Dojo.

At the same time, I've found an interesting YouTube channel that focuses on Azure, DevOps, Terraform, and other
related topics — [Azure Terraformer](https://www.youtube.com/@azure-terraformer) by Mark Tinderholt. His videos are very useful and informative,
for those interested in learning how to use Terraform with Azure ecosystem, and I highly recommend checking them out. Although it
is about more advanced topics, it is still very helpful in starting to prepare for [AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/)
and [AZ-400](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/devops-engineer/) exams.

The next step for me is to get the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator
Associate (AZ-104)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/) certificate.
