import Image from "next/image";
import { ArticleLayout } from "@/components/ArticleLayout";
import video from "./images/video.png";

export const meta = {
  author: "Anton Å½danov",
  date: "2019-04-05T21:31:48.547Z",
  title: "Must watch videos 1",
  description: "A series of videos that I found useful.",
};

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />;

<Image src={video} alt="video" />
